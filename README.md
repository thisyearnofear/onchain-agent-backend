# Onchain Agent Backend Demo

![Token-creation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/016c26cd-c599-4f7c-bafd-c8090069b53e)

A web app that enables onchain interactions through a conversational UI using AgentKit, a collaboration between [CDP SDK](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/) and [OnchainKit](https://onchainkit.xyz).

## Overview

This project features a Python backend designed to work seamlessly with CDP's AgentKit backend. Together, they enable the creation of an AI agent capable of performing onchain operations on Base. The agent uses GPT-4 for natural language understanding and AgentKit for onchain interactions.

## Modules

- The `agent` module contains functions for interacting with the onchain agent.
  - `initialize_agent` creates (or loads) an agent from CDP Wallet Data.
  - `run_agent` invokes the agent.
  - `handle_action_agent` handles agent actions - in our demo, we just save the addresses of deployed NFTs and ERC-20s to a SQLite database, but you can customize this behavior for your application.
- The `agent.custom_actions` module contains an example for adding custom actions to the agent.
  - `get_latest_block` is a custom action we've added that retrieves the latest Base Sepolia block information for the agent.
  - You can add additional custom actions to this module, following our example.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Chat Interface**: Interactive chat interface for natural language interactions onchain
- **Onchain Operations**: Ability to perform various blockchain operations through Agentkit:
  - Deploy and interact with ERC-20 tokens
  - Create and manage NFTs
  - Check wallet balances
  - Request funds from faucet
- **Real-time Updates**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses
- **Multi-language Support**: Built-in language selector for internationalization
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI built with Tailwind CSS
- **Wallet Integration**: Secure wallet management through CDP Agentkit

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python with Flask
- **AI/ML**: LangChain, GPT-4
- **Blockchain**: Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) Agentkit

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
CDP_API_KEY_NAME= # Create an API key at https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/projects/api-keys
CDP_API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY="" # Create an API key at https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/projects/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY= # Get an API key from OpenAI - https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart
NETWORK_ID=base-sepolia
```

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
poetry run python index.py
```

This will start the Python backend server.

## Agent Wallet

**Note**: when running your agent from the first time, the SDK will automatically generate a wallet for you. The wallet information will be logged to the console, and saved to the `wallets` table in the SQLite DB.

**Important**: This is for demo purposes, and we do not recommend this approach for a production application. Please save your wallet information somewhere safe.

Agents will by default be re-instantiated through the SQLite DB.

You can also instantiate your agent from the following environment variables.

```
CDP_WALLET_ID="",
CDP_WALLET_SEED=""
```

## API Usage

The application exposes a chat endpoint that accepts natural language commands for blockchain interactions:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "deploy a new ERC-20 token", "conversation_id": 0}'
```

Retrieve a list of NFTs deployed by the agent:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/nfts
```

Retrieve a list of ERC-20s deployed by the agent:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/tokens
```

## Deploying to Replit

- [Frontend Template](https://replit.com/@alissacrane1/onchain-agent-demo-frontend?v=1)
- [Backend Template](https://replit.com/@alissacrane1/onchain-agent-demo-backend?v=1)

Steps:

- Sign up for a Replit account, or login to your existing one.
- Navigate to the template links, and click `Use Template` on the top right hand side.
- Under `Secrets` in `Workspace Features`, add the environment variables below.
  - Tip: You can click `Edit as JSON` and copy the values below in.
- Click `Deploy` in the top right.
  - Tip: Deploy your backend first, as you'll need the deployment URL for the frontend's `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable.

**Backend**

```
{
  "CDP_API_KEY_NAME": "get this from https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/projects/api-keys",
  "CDP_API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY": "get this from https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/projects/api-keys",
  "OPENAI_API_KEY": "get this from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys",
  "NETWORK_ID": "base-sepolia"
}
```

**Important: Replit resets the SQLite template on every deployment, before sending funds to your agent or using it on Mainnet be sure to read [Agent Wallet](#agent-wallet) and save your wallet ID and seed in a safe place.**

**Frontend**

```
{
  "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL": "your backend deployment URL here"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### CDP SDK Authentication Issues

If you encounter authentication errors with the CDP SDK like the following:

```
Could not deserialize key data. The data may be in an incorrect format, the provided password may be incorrect, it may be encrypted with an unsupported algorithm, or it may be an unsupported key type (e.g. EC curves with explicit parameters).
```

This is typically caused by issues with how the private key is formatted or passed to the SDK. Here are two ways to resolve this:

#### Method 1: Using JSON File (Recommended)

1. Download the API key JSON file from the [CDP Portal](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/projects/api-keys)
2. Save it as `cdp_api_key.json` in your project root
3. Use the following code to configure the SDK:

```python
with open("cdp_api_key.json") as f:
    config = json.load(f)

values = {
    "cdp_api_key_name": config['name'],
    "cdp_api_key_private_key": config['privateKey']
}

agentkit = CdpAgentkitWrapper(**values)
```

#### Method 2: Using Environment Variables

If you prefer using environment variables, ensure they are formatted exactly as follows:

```bash
CDP_API_KEY_NAME="organizations/your-org-id/apiKeys/your-key-id"
CDP_API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----\nyour-key-data\n-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

Note: Some OS/terminals don't handle newline literals (`\n`) well in environment variables. In such cases, use Method 1 instead.

## Running the Server

To run the server:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. FLASK_RUN_PORT=5001 poetry run python src/agent_backend/index.py
```

Note: On macOS, port 5000 is often used by AirPlay Receiver. If you encounter a port conflict, you can:

1. Use a different port by setting `FLASK_RUN_PORT` (as shown above)
2. Disable AirPlay Receiver in System Preferences -> General -> AirDrop & Handoff
